# Computational-Physics

The notebooks in this repository contain the final results of 6 computational physics problems I have worked on. Throughout these projects, I use computational methods to integrate using Monte Carlo methods, solve differential equations with Runge-Kutta and Bulirschâ€“Stoer methods, create random number generators with a linear congruential genertors, simulate many-body interactions adhereing to physics principles, and solve grid-based 1 dimensional hydrodynamics systems.

Please reach out if you have any suggestions for changes or further work!
