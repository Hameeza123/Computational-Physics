# Computational-Physics

The notebooks in this repository contain the final results of 6 computational physics problems I have worked on. Throughout these projects, I use computational methods to integrate using Monte Carlo methods, solve differential equations with Runge-Kutta and Bulirschâ€“Stoer methods, create random number generators with a linear congruential genertors, simulate many-body interactions adhereing to physics principles, and solve grid-based 1 dimensional hydrodynamics systems. The largest project was to solve the radiative transfer equation, involving various numerical methods to solve the equation, simulate a black body, and approximate the problem to be solved inside a box of gas, using a large database of optical depth values at given temperatures densities, provided by Ian Dobbs-Dixon at NYU in Abu Dhabi.

Please reach out if you have any suggestions for changes or further work!
