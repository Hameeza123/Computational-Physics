# Computational-Physics

The notebooks in this repository contain the final results of 6 computational physics problems I have worked on. Throughout these projects, I use computational methods to integrate using Monte Carlo methods, solve differential equations with Runge-Kutta and Bulirsch–Stoer meothods, create random number generators with a linear congruential genertor, and simulate many-body interactions adhereing to physics principles.

Please reach out if you have any suggestions for changes or further work!
